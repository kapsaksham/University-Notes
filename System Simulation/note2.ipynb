    "## Notes on Rudiments of Queueing Theory (Chapter 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces the basic ideas of queueing theory, which helps us understand waiting lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Simplest Queue Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a very simple setup where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customers arrive randomly.\n",
    "* There's only one service point (server), which can handle one customer at a time.\n",
    "* The time it takes to serve a customer also varies randomly.\n",
    "* If the server is busy, arriving customers form a line (queue).\n",
    "* Customers in the line are served in the order they arrived (first-come, first-served).\n",
    "* Once a customer is served, they leave the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Poisson Arrival Pattern (How customers arrive)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze this, we make some assumptions about how customers arrive:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fixed average time gap**: There's a long-term average time between two customer arrivals, let's call this $\\alpha$.\n",
    "* **Independent arrivals**: Each customer's arrival doesn't depend on previous arrivals (the queue has no \"memory\").\n",
    "* **Probability depends on time slice**: The chance of a customer arriving in a very small time window ($h$) is proportional to that window's length ($h/\\alpha$).\n",
    "\n",
    "From these assumptions, we find that the probability of the next customer *not* arriving within a time $t$ (since the last one arrived at $t = 0$) is given by the **exponential distribution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(t) = e^{-t/\\alpha}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if customers arrive in this way, the number of customers that arrive within a fixed time interval ($t$) follows a **Poisson distribution**. The probability of exactly $k$ customers arriving in time $t$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q_k(t) = \\frac{(t\\lambda)^k}{k!} e^{-t\\lambda}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\lambda$ is the average number of customers arriving per unit of time (it's the inverse of $\\alpha$, so $\\lambda = 1/\\alpha$). Because of this relationship, \"negative exponential arrival\" and \"Poisson arrival\" are often used to mean the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Exponential Service Time (How customers are served)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We make similar assumptions about how long it takes to serve a customer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Independent servicings**: Each customer's service time doesn't affect others.\n",
    "* **Constant average service time**: There's a long-term average service time, let's call this $\\beta$.\n",
    "* **Probability depends on time slice**: The chance of completing service in a small time $h$ is proportional to $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to arrivals, the probability that a customer's service is *not* completed in time $t$ (given the previous one finished at $t = 0$) is also an exponential distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(t) = e^{-t/\\beta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Operating Characteristics (Key measures of the queue's performance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the assumptions of Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, a single server, and first-come-first-served, we can calculate important statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Utilization factor** ($\\rho$): This tells us how busy the service counter is. It's the ratio of the average service time to the average time between arrivals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho = \\frac{\\text{average service time}}{\\text{average arrival gap}} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Probability of finding the service counter free**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_0 = 1 - \\rho\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Probability of exactly $n$ customers in the system (waiting or being served):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_n = \\rho^n P_0 = \\rho^n (1 - \\rho) \\quad \\text{for } n > 0 \\text{ and } \\rho < 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average number of customers in the system:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n \\cdot P_n = \\frac{\\rho}{1 - \\rho}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average queue length** (customers waiting, not being served):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Average queue length} = \\frac{\\rho^2}{1 - \\rho}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics are called the \"operating characteristics\" of the queueing system. They help us understand how the system behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Roller Conveyor System**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a machine baling jute bundles. Bundles arrive following a Poisson distribution with an average arrival time ($\\alpha$) of 3 minutes. The baling machine's service time follows a negative exponential distribution with an average service time ($\\beta$) of 2.5 minutes. Each bundle is 1.5 meters long. How long should the conveyor be to hold waiting bundles 99% of the time?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate utilization factor:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho = \\frac{2.5}{3.0} = \\frac{5}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use probability of more than $n$ customers in the system:**\n",
    "   We want the probability of having *more than* $n$ bundles in the system to be 1% (or 0.01). This is given by $\\rho^{n+1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^{n+1} = 0.01\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $n$, we get $n \\approx 24.26$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means if the conveyor can hold 24 bundles, it will be sufficient 99% of the time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "24 \\times 1.5 \\text{ meters} = 36 \\text{ meters}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### **More Complex Queueing Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model above is very basic. Real-life queues can be much more complicated. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arrivals or service times might not follow exponential distributions.\n",
    "* There might be a priority system for different customers.\n",
    "* There could be multiple servers, working in parallel or in a series.\n",
    "* Arrival rates might change throughout the day (e.g., rush hour).\n",
    "* Customers might \"balk\" (not join a long queue) or \"renege\" (leave a queue if it's too long).\n",
    "* There might be a limit on queue length.\n",
    "* Arrivals or services might happen in \"batches\" (e.g., a busload of people).\n",
    "\n",
    "While some of these complications can be handled with more advanced mathematical formulas, often they become too complex for exact solutions. In such cases, **simulation** becomes a necessary and powerful tool to study the system's behavior.\n",
